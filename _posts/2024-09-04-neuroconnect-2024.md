### Keynote Highlights

- Dr. [Paul B. Thompson](https://keck.usc.edu/faculty-search/paul-m-thompson/) (University of Southern California) highlighted the application of artificial intelligence and deep learning methods in neuroscience, radiology, and medicine and discussed the use of convolutional neural networks, vision transformers, and other AI methods to process neuroimaging data.
- Dr. [Kamil Ugurbil] https://med.umn.edu/bio/kamil-ugurbil) (University of Minnesota) discussed the achievements of the Human Connectome Project in improving brain imaging technologies and methodologies, and the ongoing efforts to enhance magnetic resonance imaging with high magnetic fields to better understand brain circuits from neurons to whole brain networks
- Dr. [John Gilmore](https://www.med.unc.edu/psych/directory/john-gilmore/) (University of North Carolina--Chapel Hill) described a long-term study initiated in 2003 at UNC to track brain development from infancy into adolescence, particularly focusing on children at high risk for schizophrenia, including insights gained regarding normal brain development, the timing of structural differences in the brain, and the links between brain structure, function, cognition, and psychopathology among the study participants.

[Neuroimaging Statistics: Satellite Meeting of OHBM 2024](https://sites.google.com/view/neuroimaging2024) was successfully held in Seoul, South Korea from June 20 to 21, 2024.

The Neuroimaging Statistics satellite event of OHBM 2024 was organized by Dr. [Moo Chung](https://pages.stat.wisc.edu/~mchung/), Dr. [Thomas Nichols](https://www.bdi.ox.ac.uk/Team/t-e-nichols/), Dr. [Jean-Baptiste Poline](https://www.mcgill.ca/neuro/jean-baptiste-poline-phd/) and Dr. [Anqi Qi](https://cde.nus.edu.sg/bme/staff/dr-qiu-anqi/). 
The two-day symposium featured the **Keith Worsley Lecture**, delivered by [Michael I. Miller](https://www.bme.jhu.edu/people/faculty/michael-i-miller/), a leader in computational anatomy who knew Keith, a keynote by [Paul M. Thompson](https://keck.usc.edu/faculty-search/paul-m-thompson/), who has transformed neuroimaging meta analysis with the ENIGMA consortium, and 20 other talks delivered by prominent researchers working at the interface of statistics and imaging, including several SI members. The workshop was glad to have a diverse set of speakers from around the world, and hosted a poster session where many junior researchers presented their work. The event was oversubscribed and had over 100 in person participants and more attending via a Zoom broadcast.

The 2025 Statistical Methods in Imaging (SMI) conference will be held on May 19--21, 2025, at the Rice University in Houston, TX. The conference will be fully in-person. SMI is the annual meeting of the ASA Statistics in Imaging Section. 
It aims to bring together investigators from students to established researchers who are working on methods and applications in a diverse array of imaging science, including, but not limited to, biomedical imaging, digital pathology, 
single cell and spatial transcriptomics, satellite imaging, forensic imaging, astronomy, remote sensing, and materials science.

The student paper competition will feature two tracks: **1) Theory and Methods**, and **2) Case Studies and Applications**. Winners from each track will be invited to present their papers at a dedicated conference session.

JSM 2026 will be held in Boston, MA, from August 1 to August 6, 2025. The deadline for submission of invited session proposals is **Wednesday, September 3, 2025 (11:59 p.m. Eastern)**. *This is a hard deadline**. 
Please strongly consider choosing *Statistics in Imaging* as your sponsor.  

Our section has **two** allocated invited session slots, plus **two** proposals that we can submit for competitive review, so we hope to obtain **four** invited sessions.

The theme for JSM 2026 is ***"Communities in Action: Advancing Society."*** Not all sessions need to adhere to this theme, but session proposals will be more likely to succeed in the competitive review if they incorporate the theme.
 
Formats vary for invited sessions. However, all are 110 minutes in length and have a session chair. The sessions typically include 6 participants, including the chair, with the most popular and successful formats being i) 5 speakers, ii) 4 speakers with a discussant, or iii) a panel discussion consisting of 3--5 panelists.
 
You will need to have the following information to submit your session proposal online:

1. Session Type (Invited Paper or Invited Panel)
2. Sponsor (JSM partner society/ASA section or committee, Memorial, etc.). A pre-approved list is provided; select no more than three.
3. Session Title
4. Session Description (provide a short description, including focus, content, timeliness, appeal, and format)
5. Session organizer, including affiliation and email address
6. Session chair, including affiliation and email address
7. Session speakers and any discussants, including affiliations and email addresses

Please contact potential participants before submitting a proposal, as they already may have committed to participating in another session at JSM 2026.  Speakers are only allowed to speak in one invited session. There are participation [**guidelines and restrictions**](https://ww2.amstat.org/meetings/jsm/2026/submissions.cfm) regarding the number of times and in what capacity one can participate in the program.

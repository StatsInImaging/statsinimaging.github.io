Presentation Title
==================
Bayesian Longitudinal Tensor Models for High-dimensional Imaging Genetics Analysis

Abstract
==================
Imaging data often serve as effective endotypes for discovering genetic signatures driving mental disorders. The overwhelming majority of
literature has focused on penalized approaches for analyzing image-gene associations, although some limited Bayesian approaches have also
been proposed. However, existing methods routinely ignore modeling the spatial information in the brain image when analyzing image-gene
associations. Our goal is to propose a novel spatially-aware Bayesian tensor-based analysis for inferring longitudinal voxel-wise
image-gene associations that is able to map longitudinal trajectories of neurodegeneration. Some innovative features of the proposed
method include
* incorporating the spatial configuration of voxels; 
* gene network information to model the regression coefficients;
* the ability to pool information across visits to produce more reliable estimates. 

This is made possible via structured tensor-based representation for the coefficient matrices that are modeled under suitable prior
distributions incorporating gene network information. We develop an efficient Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) to implement the proposed
approach, and propose a joint credible regions approach for inferring significant features. Extensive simulation studies illustrate the
clear advantages compared to routinely used cross-sectional approaches, spatially-naive methods, as well as methods that do not incorporate
gene network knowledge. An application of the proposed approach to ADNI-1 data set reveals distinct spatial patterns of image-gene
association between two groups separated by low and high rates of cognitive decline, with such genetic signatures potentially indicative
of cognitive decline in Alzheimer's Disease.

A new ASA-sponsored open-access journal called *Statistics and Data Science in Imaging* is launched. The primary aim of the journal is to serve as a forum for discussing methodological challenges encountered in the analysis of imaging data and for presenting statistically sound solutions to those challenges. 
The journal covers a broad spectrum of statistical methods and data science techniques applicable to various imaging domains, including, but not limited to, neuroimaging, medical imaging, satellite imaging, physics, forensic imaging, astronomy, remote sensing, and materials science.

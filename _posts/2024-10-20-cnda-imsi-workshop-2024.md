The **Challenges in Neuroimaging Data Analysis Workshop**, held from August 26 to 30, 2024, at the [Institute for Mathematical and Statistical Innovation](https://www.imsi.institute/) (IMSI) in Chicago, brought together experts and early-career researchers to discuss cutting-edge advancements and challenges in neuroimaging data analysis. Keynote speakers introduced innovative imaging technologies and advanced statistical methods, including tools for mapping brain structures at micrometer to nanometer scales and models for handling large datasets. The workshop emphasized the potential of AI and deep learning, while also addressing the need for caution regarding their interpretability and generalizability. Discussions highlighted the importance of improving data preprocessing methods, integrating multi-modal imaging, and leveraging advanced computational tools. Both population-based and individual-level analyses were seen as critical to advancing neuroimaging. The workshop concluded with key future research directions, such as refining preprocessing techniques, exploring shape regression, and fostering interdisciplinary collaborations to develop problem-specific solutions.

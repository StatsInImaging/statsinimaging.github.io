High-Dimensional Directed Network Analysis of Human Brains

Abstract
==================
The human brain is a high-dimensional directed network system consisting of many regions as network nodes that exert influence on each 
other. The directed influence from one region to another is called directed connectivity and corresponds to one directed edge in the 
directed brain network. To understand how brain regions interact with each other and form different brain network patterns when performing 
different functions, we develop statistical modeling approaches to reveal high-dimensional directed brain networks using brain data. In 
this talk, I will present two models. (1) The first model is for studying normal and abnormal directed brain networks of patients with 
epilepsy using their intracranial electroencephalography (EEG) data. Epilepsy is a directed network disorder, as epileptic activity spreads 
from a seizure onset zone (SOZ) to many other regions after seizure onset. Intracranial EEG data are multivariate time series recordings of 
many brain regions. With our proposed model, we revealed the evolution of brain networks from normal to abnormal states and uncovered 
unique directed connectivity properties of the SOZ during seizure development. (2) The second model characterizes whole-brain directed 
networks of the population of healthy subjects based on functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. We also propose a 
computationally efficient algorithm to address the challenge of analyzing thousands of subjects' fMRI data. Using our new model and 
algorithm, we analyzed the resting-state fMRI data of around one thousand subjects from the Human Connectome Project (HCP). We revealed 
both population-mean and subject-specific whole-brain directed networks.

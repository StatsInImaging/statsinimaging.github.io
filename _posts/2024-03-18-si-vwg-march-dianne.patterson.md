Presentation Title
==================
What is BIDS and why do you care?

Abstract
==================
BIDS, the Brain Imaging Data Structure, is a very successful collection of recommended practices for naming and organizing neuroimaging data. It was introduced to the world in a 2016 paper with a large consortium of authors, all central to neuroimaging and from a broad range of institutions. The consequence of this standardization is really the important part of the story:

- High quality containerized processing pipelines that can easily be shared
- A standard for data sharing in neuroimaging repositories
- A way to save metadata that would otherwise be lost

Let me walk you through some of the excellent processing tools that have resulted from this effort, and we can talk about where BIDS is going in the future.

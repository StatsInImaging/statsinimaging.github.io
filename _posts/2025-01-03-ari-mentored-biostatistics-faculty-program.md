title: Call for Applications---Early Career Biostatistics Faculty Collaborating on Mental Health and Aging

This call for applications applies to junior faculty-level biostatisticians interested in collaborating with mental health and aging experts in the development of research 
projects and associated grant proposals. While not targeted directedly to their grantsmanship skills for methodology grants, many of the principles learned in this mentored 
experience would be helpful there as well. 

This opportunity to participate once in a 4-day Spring Retreat is a component of the NIH-funded Advanced Research Institute (ARI) in Mental Health and Aging. ARI is a mentored 
research education program for early career faculty ("scholars") that focuses on developing a new generation of successful researchers in mental health and aging---an area ripe 
with both challenges and opportunities. ARI builds upon a 16-year-old national mentoring network and education program with documented success1 in helping early-career faculty 
transition successfully to independent investigators (e.g., R01 funding) and scientific leaders (e.g., mentoring, scientific service). The program is supported by a network of 
senior and midcareer investigators ("faculty mentors") and supports 16 early-career scholars annually. Key elements of ARI include: sustained mentoring focused on grant-writing 
and career development, biostatistical collaboration, professional development, and an annual in-person Spring Retreat. More information about ARI can be found [here](www.mentalhealthandagingresearch.org/ari/).

A component of ARI, the Mentored Biostatistics Faculty Program, helps build the infrastructure of biostatistical collaborations by offering up to four junior biostatistics faculty 
members the opportunity to participate in the Spring Retreat. They will shadow senior ARI faculty biostatisticians to observe and practice working with early-career faculty in grant 
development. Plus, they will have opportunities to seek input from these senior biostatisticians on their collaborative roles and career development. 

Eligible applicants will be doctorate-level statisticians and biostatisticians who meet NIH early-stage investigator (ESI) criteria. The mentored biostatistics faculty will 
participate as members of the ARI Spring Retreat faculty, including participating in the small groups, seminars, and all faculty meetings. It is necessary for the applicant 
to clear his/her calendar for the four days of the 2025 Spring Retreat, so full participation is possible. The *2025 Spring Retreat* will be held **Wednesday, March 26** through 
**Saturday, March 29, 2025** at the Graylyn Estate and Conference Center in Winston-Salem, NC. 

Each selected junior biostatistical faculty member will attend a pre-Spring Retreat orientation webinar. At the retreat, each will join a different team of scholars, ARI mentors 
and senior biostatisticians, participate in all mentoring and learning activities, and attend a daily meeting of all biostatisticians for additional discussion and mentoring. 
They will be encouraged to attend ARI monthly webinars to learn more about methodological and substantive issues in this burgeoning field of research.

Travel, food and lodging expenses will be funded through ARI. Questions about this opportunity can be directed to <a href="mailto:jane.pendergast@duke.edu">Jane Pendergast</a>.

Applications are due via email (not through the ARI submission system) to <a href="mailto:Renee.L.Pepin@Dartmouth.edu">Renee Pepin</a> by <font color="red"><b>Jan, 31 2024</b></font>, and should include:

- A current CV

- An NIH biosketch

- An expression of interest in collaborations in mental health and aging (**up to 1 page**)

- Two contacts that can serve as a reference (no letters are needed)

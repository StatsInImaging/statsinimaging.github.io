JSM 2025 will be held in Nashville, Tennessee, from August 2 to August 7, 2025. The deadline for submission of [invited session proposals](https://ww2.amstat.org/meetings/jsm/2025/submissions.cfm) is Thursday, **September 5, 2024 (11:59 p.m. Eastern)**. 
This is a hard deadline. Please consider choosing the Section on Statistics in Imaging as your sponsor at [2025 Joint Statistical Meetings -- Statistics, Data Science, and AI Enriching Society](https://ww2.amstat.org/meetings/jsm/2025/).  


We encourage proposals that have a diverse group of speakers, and we encourage you to highlight diversity in your proposal description. Our section has one allocated invited session slot plus two proposals that we can submit for competitive review, so we hope to obtain three invited sessions.


The theme for JSM 2025 is "Statistics, Data Science, and AI Enriching Society." Not all sessions need to adhere to this theme, but session proposals will be more likely to succeed in the competitive review if they incorporate the theme. 
 

Formats vary for invited sessions; however, all are 110 minutes in length and have a session chair. The sessions typically include 2--6 participants, including the chair, with two of the most popular and successful formats being 2--3 speakers with a discussant or a panel discussion of 3--5 panelists.

You will need to have the following information to submit your session proposal online:

* Session Type (Invited Paper or Invited Panel)---Note: If your session will have individual presentations, please select Invited Paper as your session type.
* Sponsor (Outside Organization, ASA Committee, ASA Section (e.g., Statistics in Imaging Section), Sponsoring Society, ASA Journal)---A pre-approved list is provided; select no more than three.
* Session Title
* Session Description---Please provide a short description of the session, including focus, content, timeliness, appeal, and format.
* Session Organizer(s)---including affiliation and email address.
* Session Chair---including affiliation and email address.
* Session Speakers and Discussants---including affiliation and email address. 

Please contact potential participants before submitting a proposal, as they already may have committed to participating in another session at JSM 2025.  Speakers are only allowed to speak in one invited session. There are participation guidelines and restrictions regarding the number of times and in what capacity one can participate in the program: <ww2.amstat.org/meetings/jsm/2025/guidelines.cfm>.

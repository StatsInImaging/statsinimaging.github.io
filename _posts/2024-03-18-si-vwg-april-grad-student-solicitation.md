April's virtual working group will feature a graduate student showcase. So, graduate students, if you are interested in presenting, send <a href="mailto:julia@statlab.bio5.org>Julia Fisher</a> a talk title and abstract for your imaging-related research.  Talks can be on work in progress, finished methods development, or generally any statistical issue in or aspect of analyzing imaging data.  Students do not need to be either members of the SI section or the ASA to submit.  All are welcome.  We will determine the exact date and time of the working group based on the three selected speakers.

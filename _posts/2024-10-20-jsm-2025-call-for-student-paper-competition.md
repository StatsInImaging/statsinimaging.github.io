The selected winners will present their papers in a topic-contributed session at the Joint Statistical Meetings in Nashville, Tennessee on Aug 2, 2025 â€“ Aug 7, 2025. The first-place winner and runners-up will also receive a cash prize of $1,000 and $500, respectively.

### Application materials

The deadline for your application is **November 15, 2024**. Formal applications should be sent to the Statistics in Imaging Program Chair-Elect, Mark Fiecas, at <a href="mailto:mfiecas@umn.edu">mfiecas@umn.edu</a> with the following four attachments in PDF format:

### Selection Process

The award committee will review the papers, and winners will be notified by **December 15, 2024**. Papers are scored for 1) statistical novelty, 2) innovation and significance of contribution to the field of application, and 3) professional quality. Students may submit papers to no more than two ASA sections and may accept only one section's award. Students must inform both sections they applied to immediately when she or he wins and accepts an award, thereby removing the student from the award competition for the other section.

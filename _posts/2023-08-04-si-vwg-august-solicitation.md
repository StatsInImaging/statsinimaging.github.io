The SI Virtual Working Group is looking for an August speaker. The talk can be a length of the speaker's choosing (anywhere from 
20 to 50 minutes) and feature finished work or work in progress. It could even be a tutorial on a method of interest. If you are 
interested, please email [Julia Fisher](https://cb2.uahs.arizona.edu/profile/julia-fisher-phd) at [julia@statlab.bio5.org](mailto:julia@statlab.bio5.org).

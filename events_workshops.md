[Challenges in Neuroimaging Data Analysis Workshop](https://www.imsi.institute/activities/challenges-in-neuroimaging-data-analysis/)
==================
<b>August 26, 2024 | Chicago, IL</b>

Challenges in Neuroimaging Data Analysis Workshop, held at the [Institute for Mathematical and Statistical Innovation](https://www.imsi.institute/) 
(IMSI) in Chicago, brought together experts and early-career researchers to discuss cutting-edge advancements and challenges in 
neuroimaging data analysis. Keynote speakers introduced innovative imaging technologies and advanced statistical methods, including tools 
for mapping brain structures at micrometer to nanometer scales and models for handling large datasets. The workshop emphasized the 
potential of AI and deep learning, while also addressing the need for caution regarding their interpretability and generalizability. 
Discussions highlighted the importance of improving data preprocessing methods, integrating multi-modal imaging, and leveraging advanced 
computational tools. Both population-based and individual-level analyses were seen as critical to advancing neuroimaging. The workshop 
concluded with key future research directions, such as refining preprocessing techniques, exploring shape regression, and fostering 
interdisciplinary collaborations to develop problem-specific solutions.

[NeuroConnect 2024: Advancing Brain Network Research Workshop](https://www.unc-epic.org/)
==================
<b>August 8, 2024 | Chetola Resort, NC</b>

The UNC Education Program of Intelligence and Connectomics (UNC-EPIC) hosted the **NeuroConnect 2024: Advancing Brain Network Research Workshop** (suppoted by the NIH grant **R25DA058940**).

**Organizers**

- [Guorong Wu](https://www.med.unc.edu/psych/directory/guorong-wu/) (University of North Carolina--Chapel Hill)
- [Zhengwu Zhang](https://zhengwu.github.io/) (University of North Carolina--Chapel Hill)
- [Hongtu Zhu](https://sph.unc.edu/adv_profile/hongtu-zhu-phd/) (University of North Carolina--Chapel Hill)
- Yuyu Zhang (University of North Carolina--Chapel Hill)

**Keynote Highlights**

- Dr. [Paul M. Thompson](https://keck.usc.edu/faculty-search/paul-m-thompson/) (University of Southern California) highlighted the application of artificial intelligence and deep learning methods in neuroscience, radiology, and medicine and discussed the use of convolutional neural networks, vision transformers, and other AI methods to process neuroimaging data.
- Dr. [Kamil Ugurbil](https://med.umn.edu/bio/kamil-ugurbil) (University of Minnesota) discussed the achievements of the Human Connectome Project in improving brain imaging technologies and methodologies, and the ongoing efforts to enhance magnetic resonance imaging with high magnetic fields to better understand brain circuits from neurons to whole brain networks
- Dr. [John Gilmore](https://www.med.unc.edu/psych/directory/john-gilmore/) (University of North Carolina--Chapel Hill) described a long-term study initiated in 2003 at UNC to track brain development from infancy into adolescence, particularly focusing on children at high risk for schizophrenia, including insights gained regarding normal brain development, the timing of structural differences in the brain, and the links between brain structure, function, cognition, and psychopathology among the study participants.

[Neuroimaging Statistics Workshop in the 2023 OHBM Conference](https://neurodatascience.github.io/events)
==================
<b>June 27, 2023 | Montréal, CA</b>

Neuroimaging Statistics Workshop is organized by Dr. Thomas Nichols and Dr. Jean-Baptiste Poline. The workshop features Keynote lectures 
by distinguished imaging statisticians. In particular, the workshop will be opened with the <b>Keith Worsley Lecture</b> in honor of 
Professor Keith Worsley who was one of the most prominent imaging statisticians and pioneered important ground-work in fMRI analysis. The 
keynote is delivered by Keith's student Dr. [Jonathan Taylor](https://statweb.stanford.edu/~jtaylo/). The workshop is passionate about 
having a diverse set of speakers and including junior researchers as well. ASA Statistics in Imaging Section is a proud sponsor of the 
event.

[NIMH Workshop on Advanced Statistical Methods and Data Visualizations](https://www.nimh.nih.gov/news/events/2021/workshop-advanced-statistical-methods-and-dynamic-data-visualizations-for-mental-health-studies/)
==================
<b>June 28--30, 2021 | Virtual</b>

This is a two-day virtual workshop on Advanced Statistical Methods and Dynamic Data Visualizations for Mental Health Studies 
organized by [National Institute of Mental Health](https://www.nimh.nih.gov/). The major objectives of this workshop are to identify 
gaps in statistical methods and data visualization tools for mental health studies, and to promote discussions among statisticians, data scientists, computational 
scientists, quantitative neuroscientists, psychiatrists and psychologists to identify best practices for evaluating and interpreting 
meaningful effects in mental health research.

<ins>Day One</ins> (June 28, 2021): <i>Advances in Statistical Methods and Applications</i>

The goal of the day one workshop is to address the role of statistical methods in identifying meaningful effects in large neuro-behavioral 
samples (including neuroimaging and behavioral data), administrative data, or social media sources.

<ins>Day Two</ins> (June 30, 2021): <i>Dynamic and Interactive Data Visualizations</i>

The goal of the day two workshop is to showcase advanced methods for dynamic and interactive data visualization. There will also be 
opportunities for participants to gain hands-on experience with cutting-edge visualization tools via interactive tutorial sessions.
